# HTML5 & CSS Practice Project
Welcome to my practice project repository! This project is a personal endeavor to revisit and sharpen my HTML5 and CSS skills. Drawing inspiration from a design challenge found on 'Frontend Mentor', I aimed to recreate the specified design using only HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview
The core objective of this project was to accurately replicate a given design, focusing purely on the fundamentals of web development. By adhering strictly to HTML5 and CSS, this exercise served as a back-to-basics approach, allowing me to refine my understanding and execution of web layout techniques, responsive design principles, and CSS styling.

## Features
- Pure HTML5 & CSS: No frameworks or libraries were used, emphasizing raw coding skills and a deep dive into the nuances of these foundational technologies.
- Responsive Design: Efforts were made to ensure that the web page is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.
- Modern CSS Practices: Utilized modern CSS properties and techniques, such as Flexbox and Grid, to achieve the desired layout and responsiveness.
